			<p>Your innate magic comes from a past encounter with death. Most often, this origin is traced back to surviving an attack from an undead, such as a vampire’s bite, a ghost’s possession, or a specter’s life drain. Or, it could have originated from an imperfect revival or near-death experience. Regardless of the way you attained this dark magic, it now dictates your life and greatly augments your power.</p>

			<p>Starting at 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet. When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the darkness spell, which doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.</p>

			<p>Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics (see the <i>Monster Manual</i> or appendix C in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>), with the following changes: The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
				<li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
				<li>At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>
