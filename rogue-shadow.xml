			<p>Some rogues choose to delve into the intricacies of shadow magic, using its unique powers to enhance their skills in stealth and deception. These rogues are a very diverse subset, from simple thieves to hired killers to highly trained bounty hunters. By learning how to separate their shadow from their body, shadow rogues become difficult to catch and even harder to kill.</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can separate your shadow from your body, creating a shadowy replica of yourself and causing you to no longer cast a shadow. This replica is completely opaque and solid, and looks like a three-dimensional silhouette of yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you may separate your shadow and then move it up to 30 feet as part of the same action. The shadow shares your statistics, and can perform all movements that you would be able to, making ability checks for any movements that would normally require them, but it cannot take any actions. The shadow is susceptible to saving throws and attacks, including opportunity attacks, and it shares your AC. If it takes any damage, it instantly disappears. Your separated shadow can count as an enemy of a hostile creature for the purpose of granting sneak attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">On subsequent turns while you are separated from your shadow by less than 120 feet, you may move it another 30 feet (no action required). As a bonus action on your turn, you may choose to teleport to the location of your shadow, reuniting yourself with it. You can also reunite with your shadow by moving into its space.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you teleport to your shadow, you can’t teleport to it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
