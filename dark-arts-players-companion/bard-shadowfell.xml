			<p>Bards of the College of the Shadowfell specialize in the study of that realm, gleaming great knowledge of shadow magic in the process. These bards are few in number 
			and their study is far harder than most, for knowledge of the Shadowfell is hard to come by. These bards occasionally gather in great libraries to share their knowledge, 
			but most of their time is spent out in the world, looking for any glimpses of knowledge that might lead them to their goal.</p>
			<p class="indent">These bards generally do not perform music, and are instead more inclined to creating stories and manufacturing histories, with most of these stories ending as dark as the realm they study.</p>

			<p>You can lace your words with shadow magic to grant an ally unnatural speed. When a creature that has a bardic inspiration die from you begins to 
			move, it can choose to roll that die and add 5 times the number rolled to its speed until the end of its turn. For the same duration, every 2 feet of its movement in dim 
			light or darkness only costs 1 foot of speed.</p>
