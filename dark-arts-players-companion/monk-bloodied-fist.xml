		<description>
			<p>Monks of the Way of the Bloodied Fist follow a tradition that teaches them to control their own life force, as well as the life force of their foes. By focusing their ki, they exert control over blood - a powerful tool that is not to be underestimated. Their monasteries practice in secret in dark caves and high mountains, out of the eye of the common people, and their members only leave for the rare missions ordered by only the most desperate.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many monks of this tradition are covered in scars - some self-inflicted in their training, and others earned in battle. The monks often use their mystic energies to manipulate these scars, forming them into complex designs and symbols to represent their unique ki powers.</p>

			<p>At 17th level, you can take complete control of a creature by manipulating its blood. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to attempt to grasp control over that creature. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall under your control. Constructs and elementals automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">On every subsequent turn after assuming control, you must use your action to take total and precise control of the target. To assert your control, you must be able to see the target and it must be within 120 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. If you do not take this action on your turn, the control ends prematurely. This control can last for up to 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).</p>
			<p class="indent">Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Constitution saving throw against the effect. If the saving throw succeeds, the effect ends.</p>

			<description>When you hit a creature (except Constructs and Elementals) with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to take control of the creature. It must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or be controlled by you. You must use your action each turn to maintain crontrol, and the creature must remain within 120 feet of you. The creature only takes actions you choose, and you can cause the creature to use a reaction (uses yours as well). The control lasts for up to 1 hour or until you lose Concentration, the creature moves out of range or you do not use your action to maintain it. Each time the creature takes damage, it can roll the Constitution Save again, ending the effect on a success.</description>
