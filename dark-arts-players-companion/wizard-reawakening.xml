			<p>As a member of the school of reawakening, you combine the forces of necromancy with the power of conjuration. By transforming the necromantic energies of the creatures you kill into completely new conjurations, you bridge the gap between these two school of magic, creating a hybrid school that combines elements of both Conjuration and Necromancy. As you progress, you learn to shape together ever more powerful conjurations.</p>

			<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to store a creature’s soul for later use. You gain a Soul Vial, which can be used to store the soul of a creature with a challenge rating as high as 1/2. By using a 10 minute ritual on a creature that has died within the last hour, you can store that creature’s soul in the vial. If there is already a soul within the vial, then the new soul replaces it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you have a soul contained within your Soul Vial, you can release it to reform that creature. The creature has the same statistics as the creature you gathered the soul from, but it appears slightly translucent and visibly magical. Once formed, the creature lasts for up to 1 hour, and requires your concentration to maintain. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. Once the duration ends, the creature’s soul is freed and the vial is emptied.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you form a creature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting at 6th level, you can capture the soul of a creature with a CR as high as your wizard level divided by 3, rounded down.</p>
