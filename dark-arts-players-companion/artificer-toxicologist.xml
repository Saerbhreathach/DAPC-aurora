		<description>
			<p>Toxicologist specializes in the making, administering, and detection of poisons, with some dabbling in acids as well. This specialization developed as an offshoot of alchemy, for those that were uninterested in the idea of creating life-giving concoctions and instead hyper-specialized into dealing death. Toxicologists craft various deadly toxins, each with their own purpose. And to administer these poisons, they often make use of the blowgun—a small, stealthy weapon ideal for their purposes.</p>

		<description>
			<p><em>3rd-level Toxicologist feature</em></p>
			<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a vial, magically adding an injection needle onto the vial and filling it with an arcane toxin. When you create the toxin, you choose its effect from the Arcane Toxins table.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creating an arcane toxin requires you to have a poisoner’s kit on your person, and any toxin you create with this feature lasts until it is injected or until the end of your next long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">The injection needles are magic weapons that can be used as blowgun ammunition or improvised melee weapons. When a filled injection needle hits a creature, it deals the normal damage of a blowgun needle and injects its entire contents into the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your artificer spell save DC. The effect of this saving throw is based on the toxin chosen. Needles that miss can usually be recovered and reused unless intentionally destroyed, as the magic used to create an injection needle also strengthens it.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more arcane toxins at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Each toxin requires its own vial.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can create additional arcane toxins by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the toxin in an empty vial you touch, and you choose the toxin’s effect from the Arcane Toxins table. If you expend a slot of 2nd level or higher, the toxin deals 1d6 bonus poison damage on a hit for each slot level above 1st.</p>

				<tr><td>Death</td><td>The target takes 4d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Mind Fog</td><td>The target takes 1d6 poison damage. On a failed save, whenever the target makes an attack roll or a saving throw during the next minute, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature immune to poison is immune to this effect.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Paranoia</td><td>On a failed save, the target is frightened of all creatures it can see for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature immune to poison is immune to this effect.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Sickness</td><td>The target takes 2d6 poison damage. On a failed save, it is also poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</td></tr>
