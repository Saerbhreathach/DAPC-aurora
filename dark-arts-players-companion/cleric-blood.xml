			<p>The gods of blood are patrons of all varieties of slaughter — including war, battle, murder, and even hunting—and accept any shedding of blood as an offering to their 
			domain. They are the patrons of warriors, particularly those of a more chaotic disposition. While many clerics that follow a blood deity resemble deranged, blood-thirsty 
			cultists, others are comparable to the followers of particularly violent war deities. Examples of the deities of this domain are Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, and Shezmu, 
			the Lord of Blood.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 17th level, the dark magic you cast can cause deep, gushing wounds to appear on the body of an affected creature. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage or has the hemomancy tag, you can force one creature that took damage from the spell to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is wounded for 1 minute. The wound ends early if the creature receives magical healing, uses their action to staunch the wound, or if you use this feature again.</p>
