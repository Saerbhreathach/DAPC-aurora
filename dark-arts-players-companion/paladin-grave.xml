		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Grave is a seldom practised tradition, most commonly reserved for the followers of the Raven Queen. Sometimes called winter knights, black knights, or grave knights, these paladins serve as protectors of the sacred passings into the afterlife. They constantly struggle against the forces of undeath, as they see them as the most unholy abominations that blight this land. They adorn themselves with images of death and winter - skulls, ravens, or similar symbols of their patron gods.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Tenets of the Gravce</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of the grave have been passed down for generations. This oath emphasizes the passing between the warmth of life to the everlasting cold of death, and punishes those that defile this passing with the unholy raising of undead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Annihilate the Unholy.</i></b> The undead and those who foster them are unholy and wicked. Destroy them before they defile more than they have already.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Preserve the Righteous.</i></b> Death should not come early to those who have led a blessed life . Preserve the righteous, so they may live on without fear.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Let Souls Pass On.</i></b> Every soul deserves its place in the afterlife. When you see a creature forced into undeath, let its soul go free.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Accept Death.</i></b> Death comes to all eventually. Accept it, and you will find a place in the afterlife.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Icy Repose.</i></b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer against undeath, using your Channel Divinity. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes cold damage equal to your paladin level, and is frozen for 1 minute or until it takes damage again.</p>
			<p class="indent">A frozen creature is affected by the petrified condition until the frozen effect ends, at which point the creature is freed and able to act normally.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Restbringer.</i></b> As action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with necrotic energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add 1 + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage (minimum 1) to your damage rolls made with that weapon. Additionally, hitting a target with the weapon marks them until the end of your next turn. A marked target can’t regain hit points, and if it dies while marked, it can’t become undead.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
