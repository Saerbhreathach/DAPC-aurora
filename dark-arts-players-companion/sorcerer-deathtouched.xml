			<p>Your innate magic comes from a past encounter with death. Most often, this origin is traced back to surviving an attack from an undead, such as a vampire’s bite, a ghost’s possession, or a specter’s life drain. Or, it could have originated from an imperfect revival or near-death experience. Regardless of the way you attained this dark magic, it now dictates your life and greatly augments your power.</p>

			<p>Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to access the memories of the deceased. By performing a 1 minute ritual on a corpse, you can gain insight into how that creature died. If you already witnessed that creature’s death, you instead gain another random memory from that creature, as determined by your DM. This feature can only be used once per corpse.</p>

			<p>At 18th level, you gain the ability to take control of another creature’s body. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to attempt to possess a creature of size Large or smaller within 5 feet of you.

While possessing a creature, you can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and you retain your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You otherwise use the possessed target's statistics, but don’t gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</p>

You may also end the effect using your bonus action. A target is immune to Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw.</p>
