			<p>The Path of Blood is a path taken by only the most ruthless and battle-hungry barbarians. Touched by dark powers, the rage of these barbarians calls upon the mystical powers of hemomancy to drain the life of their foes. Barbarians that follow this path tend to come from especially savage tribes that participate in frequent blood sacrifices of beasts or even fellow humanoids.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-level Path of Blood feature</em></p>
			<p>You learn to channel hemomancy through your rage, allowing you to imbue dark power into your weaponry and drain the life of those that dare to strike you. While you rage, your speed is increased by 10 feet, and whenever you deal damage with a weapon, you can choose to deal necrotic or poison damage (your choice) instead of the weapon’s normal damage type. If you do so, you can roll the damage roll twice, and take the higher of the two rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also during your rage, when a creature within 10 feet of you deals damage to you of a damage type that you have resistance to, you can choose to take that damage as if you had no resistance to it (no action required). If you choose to do so, the creature that damaged you takes necrotic or poison damage (your choice) equal to half the damage you took.</p>

			<p>You gain the ability to smell the scent of the injured from up to a mile away, and accurately pinpoint the scent’s direction. Once you get within 1000 feet of the source, you can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to determine its exact identity. On a success, you know the exact identity of the creature if you have encountered it before; otherwise you only determine its type and the severity of its injury. Either way on a success, you know the exact distance and direction to the injured creature. On a failed check, you know that you failed the check and can’t make another one for 1 hour.</p>

			<p>Touching spilled blood allows you to see the circumstances under which the blood was spilled. As an action, you can touch at least a drop of blood that has been spilled within the last 48 hours. For the next 12 seconds, you become blind and deaf to your own senses as your mind experiences the minute that led to that blood being spilled, from the point of view of the one whose blood was spilled.</p>
