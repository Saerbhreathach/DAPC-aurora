			<p>The Path of Blood is a path taken by only the most ruthless and battle-hungry barbarians. They do not care when they shed their own blood - in fact, they use that 
			energy to empower their rage even farther, using their suffering to inflict wounds upon their foes through magical bonds of blood.</p>
			<p class="indent">While at first glance the Path of Blood appears to be powered by the same forces as the Path of the Berserker, the Path of Blood is far more magical 
			in nature. Bloodragers use their blood in a form of hemomancy - a magic that utilizes blood sacrifices.</p>

			<p>You can choose to ignite your blood with magical power during you rage. At the end of each of your turns while raging, you can choose to take 1d4 + half your barbarian 
			level necrotic damage to release a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to the necrotic damage you 
			took. The necrotic damage you take ignores resistance or immunity.</p>

			<p><em>6th-level Path of Blood feature</em></p>
			<p>You gain the ability to smell the scent of the injured from up to a mile away, and accurately pinpoint the scent’s direction. Once you get within 1000 feet of the 
			source, you can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to determine its exact identity. On a success, you know the exact identity of the creature if you have encountered 
			it before; otherwise you only determine its type and the severity of its injury. Either way on a success, you know the exact distance and direction to the injured 
			creature. On a failed check, you know that you failed the check and can’t make another one for 1 hour.</p>

			<p>Touching spilled blood allows you to see the circumstances under which the blood was spilled. As an action, you can touch at least a drop of blood that has been 
			spilled within the last 48 hours. For the next 12 seconds, you become blind and deaf to your own senses as your mind experiences the minute that led to that blood being 
			spilled, from the point of view of the one whose blood was spilled.</p>
